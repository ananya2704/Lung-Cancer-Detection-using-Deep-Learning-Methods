# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Methods

Around five million deadly cases of lung cancer have been recorded around the year.Lung cancer is one of the main causes of death in women and men. When there is an uncontrollable growth in an area of lung tissue it basically characterizes a tumor that is malignant,this is lung cancer. An early detection of this lethal disease is the need of the hour.
Early detection would increase the survival rate of the patient and reduce the mortality rate , as the treatment would begin early and likely to be more curative.

These abnormal cells interfere with the regular lung cells' ability to operate, which could result in lung tissue that is harmful. Tumors occur and form as a result of the expansion of these abnormal processes, which also impairs the lung's ability to provide oxygen to the body through the blood.

An efficient medical screening test that is used for detecting cancer is Computed tomography imaging. The precise information provided by chest CT (computed tomography) scan images of aberrant lung cells is utilized to identify lung cancer and reduce the risk of lung cancer death.

This work's primary goals are to analyze , pre process the CT scan lung images provided to us and then using deep learning methods try to identify the severity of these cancerous nodules and perform classification tasks on them accordingly. This study employs deep learning techniques in order to provide ways for early detection and recovery.


The dataset that we have used is from Kaggle. The Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases (IQ-OTH/NCCD) lung cancer dataset
was collected in the above-mentioned specialist hospitals over a period of three months in fall 2019. It includes CT scans of patients diagnosed with lung cancer in different stages, as well as healthy subjects. 

The dataset has total 1097 images from 110 patients that is grouped into 3 different categories namely, normal, benign, and malignant.
